# WeatherApp

Hi,

The Zappos Weather App created by me contains following screens ::

1) Current Location Temperature : If GPS is not working, temperature of home location will be shown.
      User can select "Set as home location", "Show current location" and "Show Home Location"
2) Hourly Forecast : Swipe Right to see Hourly forcast for the selected location.
3) Daily Forecast : Swipe Further Right to see Daily forcast for next 7 days for current location.
4) Search Button : When clicked search button on bottom of the screen, Sliding window to search a location will appear. Search
  will only work if editor has more than 1 char.
5) Refresh button : On right corner of Current Temperature screen, refresh can be done manually.
6) Click on C or F beside the  temperature to change the units.

** Special Feature **

1) When application is running(in Foreground or Background), tap power button twice. You don't have to unlock device to see
  temperature. You can listen current temperature.
  
2) Do check About US page ;)

For any doubt please mail me at piyushagal@ufl.edu
